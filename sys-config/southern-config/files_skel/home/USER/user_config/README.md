# Southern-Tools "user_config" folder

Minimalistic configuration for Gentoo (amd64) based on i3-gaps and sway. I also include some nice tools.

**IMPORTANT: This is still a work in progress, etc...**

* After downloading, you must execute the script at '/scripts/southern\_tools\_install.sh' to set up properly everything (**DANGEROUS**, STILL DOESNÂ´T WORK).
